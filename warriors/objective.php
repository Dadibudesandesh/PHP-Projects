   <h2>To fulfill the dream of seeing Swarajya, <br>
   at the feet of all those Shivpaik Mavals<br>
    who sacrificed their lives in that fiery furnace,
   <br> I pay my respects.</h2><br>
   <h3>
   February 19, 1630, no. 1627 maybe but I think 1630 is fine. This question is not only for me but for all Shiva-loving Mavals, when was the Maharaja born and should we celebrate his birth day according to the date or according to the date ... ??? Anyway ..
<br>
Feb 19 In the year 1630, Mahadev was born in the form of Shivaraya in the land of Maharashtra for the protection of God, country and religion.

On 6th June 1674, the coronation ceremony of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was performed by Pandit Gaga Bhatt and the ryate's self-government was established. He remembered Mawla Tanaji Malusare when he saw her<br>
"Raj Aisaheb's dream was to bring Hi Kondhana to Swarajya. First, I joined Kondhana and then my Raibach, leaving aside the marriage of his own child, went to capture Kondhana for Swarajya. He said, "Maharaj, put your cloth on your body and this body has become pure. Look, the spear has penetrated through the chest, but we did not bow down because we had a headband on our heads. We died as Raj Shivaji Maharaj. We were blessed. Our life became meaningful." Mawla like Shiva Kashid met Maharajah and he disguised himself as Shivaraya and entered the camp of Mughals and made life meaningful<br>
After Maharaj came near the throne, he stood in front of Maharaj, Mawla Bajiprabhu Deshpande I will not give, even if lakhs die, it will work, but the breadwinner of lakhs must live. Even today, these words are echoing in that gap. Not only that, but in the blood of that Mawla, that gorge came to be known as Pavankhind. Many such Mavals came to work for Swarajya. Many Mavals themselves spent their lives for the creation of Swarajya. So even today, 400 years later, his name is still proudly mentioned. Poems and poems are composed on them. Remember the definition of "Mawla" as a wonderful confluence of Swami Bhakti, Swaminishtha and Swabhiman. Not only that, for the fulfillment of Maharaj's dream, for the creation of nation and Swarajya, standing firm like Sahyadri and inflicting the sword wounds of the enemy on his chest, it is Mavalech Ho. . There was a time when everyone was united under one saffron flag but now which flag should we take? Such a question is facing everyone. Because now there are less activists and more leaders from the streets to Delhi, everyone has formed their own organization according to their convenience. That is why today's young generation is not interested in serving the country and serving the nation. They are doing the work of protection which they call Shivakarya.<br>
If we don't study today's situation, only today

The rhetoric is on.

The one who is not is just walking around bombing. Do it Do it That is what would have happened. That's how they lived. And there is nothing in itself. Nowadays, there are speakers whose speeches make people emotional, forgetting everything and not only listening intently, but also getting tears in their eyes. Cities stand on their own two feet, but by the time the show is over, the audience has shaken off his shorts and just finished the speech. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj used to communicate with his Mavals only with his eyes and Mavals were also so loyal that they knew immediately what their king wanted. There was no need for words because that dialogue used to be of a Guru-disciple and God and a devotee. Now

But nothing like that. Once when Shivaji Maharaj was trapped at Panhalgad, the Maharajah devised a plan to get out of it. Maharaj looked at him and was surprised because he looked like Shivaji Maharaj. He had the same name. Mawla Shiva Kashid Maharaj spoke to him. He will not even recognize us and when he heard these words, Maharaj said to him, "Shiva, how do you know that we are going to make you Shivaji Maharaj and send you on a visit to Ganima?" Then Shiva said Maharaj your place is in our heart and we will not know what is in your mind. We all know that your only command is to leave the fort for sure. Until then, we will stop the looting. Because even the present Guru is not so powerful and the disciple is not always his.
<br>
Why am I mentioning Shivaji Maharaj like this? If such a question has been asked by all, you would like to say that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born on the back of the world as a personality who has a god in the temple today, Tulsi in the door and respect for the female caste in the society. Who is Shivaji Maharaj? The soil of this place keeps the heroic story of Shivaraya's glory in his heart. No matter how many times Bhosle Kuladhikulbhushan is mentioned.

And even so, today's generation is crazy about Shiva. On the car, on the T-shirt, on the body (Gondhan), on the neck (locket), on the hand (ring) Shivaji Maharaj is seen walking around with his demeanor. I feel ashamed of things and also get angry at his behavior.<br>
All I want to say to today's young generation is that instead of standing on Gadkillas and taking photos, you should stand firm and proud like Gadkillas, then Shivaraya's self-government will last and then you will get proof that you are a true Mavale. Today, many organizations are seen doing fort conservation and selfless social service keeping in view the ideal of Shivaraya. He is also seen carrying out a fort cleaning campaign. So support these organizations and work with them to nurture the fort of Swarajya and protect the forts that defended you 400 years ago today because if the forts survive then history will survive and if history survives then the nation will survive and whoever is blessed to do so. So I believe he is the real Mawla. Because the real value of a fort is a real Mavalya.
