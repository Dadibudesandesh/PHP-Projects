                <p> was a military leader in the Maratha Empire of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

                <h4>History of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Tanaji Malusare</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Tanaji Malusare were close friends, and during their childhood, they used to make strategies to capture the forts.
                    Later, Shivaji won many battles with the help of Tanaji, Baji Prabhu, and thousands of Maratha warriors. Tanaji became eternal in history for fighting
                    the battle of Sinhagad 1670. Tanaji was preparing for his son's wedding when Shivaji called him for the battle. He left his son's wedding and followed Shivaji.
                    Tanaji fought bravely till his last breath and died in the battle. Shivaji was deeply affected by his friend's death, and on his death, he said,
                    'Gad ala pan Sinh gela' which means 'The fort was captured but the lion was dead'.

                <p>
                    In the year 1670, Tanaji was summoned by Shivaji for a meeting, in which Shivaji told him that he had to recapture Kondana fort near Pune from the Mughals. It was a matter
                    of honour for him. Tanaji replied that he would liberate the fort from the Mughals at any cost. The Mughal leader 'Udaybhan Rathore', who was leading 5 thousands
                    Mughal soldiers to guard the fort was a Hindu, but due to his selfish motives, he joined the Mughal army. The whole fort was guarded by the Mughals except the western
                    part of the fort which was covered by high rocks. Tanaji decided to invade the fort through this route for which he took the help of Bengal Monitor Lizard (Ghorpad)
                    named 'Yashwanti'. They tied a rope to a lizard and went crawling up to the fort. He successfully entered the fort with the help of 342 soldiers.
                    <br> Tanaji's brother 'Suryaji' with 300 Mavalas moved close to the gates of the fort-Kalyan Darwaja. Tanaji and Udaybhan fought fiercely in which Udaybhan broke Tanaji's Dhal, but Tanaji continued
                    the fight by tying a cloth on his left hand for protection. Udaybhan deceived Tanaji and killed him. Suryaji and Shelar Mama (an old Sardar in his 70s)retreated to this
                    and killed Udaybhan. the Marathas were successful in recapturing the fort from the Mughals.
