                <h4>Role of Hambirrao in coronation of Sambhaji</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Shivaji died on 3 April 1680. On 21 April, the corrupt ministers of Swarajya crowned Rajaram. At that time Rajaram was only ten years old. Rajaram was the nephew of Hambirrao.
                    The ministers of Swarajya ordered Sambhaji to be imprisoned. When Hambirrao came to know about this, Hambirrao captured all the ministers and presented them to Sambhaji.
                    <br>This shows how deep Hambirao's undying loyalty to Swarajya was.
