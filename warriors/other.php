          <td><img src="img/Shahaji,_the_King-Maker.jpg" height="450" width="350"></td>
          <td><h3>Early life</h3>
            Shahaji was the son of Maloji Bhosale, a soldier who eventually became Sar Giroh and was awarded 
            the jagirs of Pune and Supe districts in the court of Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar.


            Hazrat Shah Sharif Dargah where maloji asked for his two sons to the Muslim saint
            Maloji was childless for a long time. With the blessings of a Sufi Muslim pir called Shah Sharif, two sons were born to him. Maloji named his sons Shahaji and Sharifji in honour of the pir.[3][4] Shahaji married Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhav, another 
            Maratha general in the service of Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar when both of them were children.
          <h3>Early career</h3>Like his father Maloji, Shahaji served in the army of Malik Ambar of Ahmadnagar Sultanate. At the time of Maloji's death in 1622, 26-year old Shahaji was a minor commander in Malik Ambar's army.
           By 1625, he held the high military position of Sar Lashkar, as suggested by a letter sent from Pune on 28 July.[7]

          Ahmadnagar was involved in conflicts against the northern Mughal Empire and other Deccan Sultanates, and Shahaji kept shifting his loyalty between these states. For example, sometime before the Battle of Bhatvadi (1624), Shahaji and some other Maratha leaders defected to the Mughals, 
          but shortly before the battle they returned to Ahmadnagar. Malik Ambar's army defeated a combined Mughal-Bijapur army in the battle.[6] Subsequently, a quarrel arose between Shahaji and his cousin Kheloji Bhonsle, and in 1625 Shahaji shifted his allegiance to Bijapur,[8] probably because he was dissatisfied with Ahmadnagar
           rewarding his relatives more than him. He retained his jagir in the Pune region, which was disputed between Ahmadnagar and Bijapur.
           A letter dated 10 January 1626 indicates that he still held the position of Sar Lashkar.
          
          Shahaji's patron in Bijapur - Ibrahim Adil Shah II - died in September 1627.[9] Ibrahim Adil Shah II, a Muslim, was tolerant towards Hindus like Shahaji and saw Ahmadnagar as a buffer state between his kingdom and the Mughal Empire.
           After his death, an orthodox Muslim faction that advocated an alliance with the Mughals against Ahmadnagar grew stronger in Bijapur.[8] Amid these circumstances, Shahaji returned to Ahmadnagar in early 1628,[9] under the patronage of Malik Ambar's son Fatah Khan.
            The power of Ahmadnagar had been declining after Malik Ambar's death in 1626, but Shahaji held a higher position there than the one he held in Bijapur. Meanwhile, the newly-crowned Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan launched a fresh campaign against Ahmadnagar. In 1629, Shahaji led a 6,000-strong cavalry against the Mughals in the Khandesh region but was defeated.
          <h3>War against the Mughals</h3>In 1632, Malik Ambar's son Fatah Khan placed a puppet ruler on the Ahmadnagar throne and allied with the Mughals. As a reward, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan granted him the jagir that had been earlier allotted to Shahaji.[12] Shahji then left the Mughal service and started plundering the region around Pune. When the Mughals sent an army against him,
           he took shelter with the governor of Junnar, and subsequently returned to Bijapur service.[11]

          From 1630 to 1632, northern Maharashtra suffered from a severe famine, called the Mahadurga famine. Bijapur sent an army to assist Ahmadnagar against the Mughals, who had besieged the Daulatabad fort. The Mughals emerged victorious and captured Daultabad, the capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Shahaji retreated and took control of an area in the southern part of the Ahmadngar Sultanate. 
          This area included lands in the triangle formed by the Nashik, Pune, and Ahmadnagar cities.[11] Unlike southern Maharashtra, which was directly administered by the Bijapur government, this region was politically unstable because of constant warfare between Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and the Mughals. The political control of this region had changed at least ten times from 1600 to 1635 with the government infrastructure in the area largely destroyed.[13] Shahaji's control over this area was very weak, but he maintained an army of 2,000-10,000 men and provided service to the Ahmadnagar troops fleeing their state after the Mughal conquest.[11]
          
          Meanwhile, in Daulatabad, the Mughals imprisoned the nominal king of Ahamadnagar.[11] Shahaji installed 10-year old Murtaza of the Ahamadnagar royal family as the titular puppet ruler[14] and appointed himself chief minister.[15] Within a year, Shahaji's army captured Junnar and a large part of northern Konkan region. Shahaji resided in Junnar and raised an army, which at its height, 
          included 12,000 soldiers. The strength of his army kept changing because of the changing loyalty of the various subordinate chiefs, including Ghatge, Kate, Gaikwad, Kank, Chavan, Mohite, Mahadik, Pandhre, Wagh, and Ghorpade.[11] He set up his capital at Shahabad and gained control of several large forts. A contemporary Brahmin newsletter of Bijapur states that the area controlled by him, not including his jagir of Pune and Indapur, yielded 7.5 million rupees in revenue. This estimate was based on the potential rather than the actual revenue: the area had been devastated by war and famine, and the actual revenue collected was probably far smaller.[16] The warring armies had destroyed several villages in the area to deny their enemies revenue, and most of the remaining villages yielded revenue only when forced to do so.[17] According to the newsletter, 
          his forces included a 3,000-strong cavalry, plus an additional 2,000-strong contingent from Bijapur.</td>

          <td><h3>History</h3>
            <p>Jijabai was born on 12 January 1598, to Mahalasabai Jadhav and Lakhuji Jadhav of Deulgaon, near Sindkhed, in present-day Buldhana district of Maharastra. 
            Lakhojiraje Jadhav was a Maratha noble. Jijabai was married at an early age to Shahaji Bhosle, son of Maloji Bhosle of Verul village, a military commander serving under the Nizam Shahi sultans.
             She taught Shivaji about swarajya and raised him to be a great warrior.[4] Jijabai died on 17 June 1674.[5] C.V. Vaidya in his book Medieval India, states that Yadavas are "definitely pure Maratha Kshatriyas". 
             Jijabai (the mother of Shivaji, who founded the Maratha Empire) belonged to the clan of jadhavas of Sindkhed Raja, who also claimed descent from the Ahirs/Yadavas.</p>
             <p><h3>Life and work</h3>
                When Shivaji was 14 years old, Shahaji Raje handed over the Jagir of Pune to him. Of course, the responsibility of managing the Jagir fell on Jijabai. 
                Jijabai and Shivaji arrived in Pune with skilled officers. Due to the persistent interests of Nizamshah, Adilshah and Mughals, the condition of Pune was very bad. Under such adverse circumstances, she along with Dadoji Kondadeo redeveloped the city of Pune. She plowed the farmland with a golden plow, giving sanctuary to the locals. She was responsible for the education of the kings. Jijabai told Shivaji stories from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, which began and ended in independence. How mighty was Rama who killed Ravana who was depriving Sita, how mighty was Bhima who killed Bakasura and rescued weak people, etc. Because of these rites given by Jijabai, Shivaji Raje happened. Jijabai not only told the story but also gave the first lessons of politics by sitting next to the chair.[8]
                
                She was also a skilled horse rider. She could wield a sword very skillfully. She managed her husband's Jagir in Pune and developed it. She established Kasba Ganapati Mandir. She also renovated Kevareshwar Temple and Tambadi Jogeshwari Temple.</p>
                <p><h3>Death</h3>
                    She died on 17 June 1674 at Pachad village near Raigad Fort. At that time it was only twelve days since the coronation of Shivaji</p></td>

          <td><h3>Early life</h3>
            Ahilya Bai was born into a Marathi Hindu family to Mankoji Shinde and Sushila Shinde in the Chaundi village (present-day Ahmednagar district) of Maharashtra, where her father, Mankoji Shinde, a scion of a respectable Dhangar family, served as the Patil. Although women did not go to school back then, Ahilya's father taught her to read and write.
           
            According to a legend, she rose to prominence when Malhar Rao Holkar, a commander in the army of Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I and ruler of Malwa ,stopped in Chaundi on his way to Pune and saw the eight-year-old Ahilya at a temple service in the village. 
            Impressed by her piety and character, Malhar married Ahilya to his son, Khande Rao Holkar on the Peshwas advice. 
            She married Khande Rao in 1733. 
            Ahilya accompanied Khande Rao on many campaigns. Throughout her married life, she was brought up by her mother in law Gautama Bai who is credited today for the values instiled in Ahilya. 
            She trained her into administration, accounts, politics etc and eventually handed over her Khasgi Jagir in 1759.
            
            In 1754, Khande Rao, alongside his father Malhar Rao Holkar, laid the siege of Kumher fort of Jat Raja Suraj Mal of Bharatpur on request of support from Imad-ul-Mulk and the Mughal emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur's general Mir Bakhshi. Suraj Mal had sided with the Mughal emperor's rebellious wazir Safdar Jang. Khande Rao was inspecting his troops in an open palanquin during the battle when a cannonball fired from the Jat army hit him, leading to his death.[6][better source needed]
            
            After the death of her husband, Ahilya Bai was stopped by her father in law from committing sati.
             After demise of her husband she was trained in military affairs by Malhar Rao holkar.
            <h3>Death</h3>
            Ahilyabai died on 13 August 1795 at the age of 70. A woman of modern times, Ahilyabai's rule is remembered as a golden age in the history of Maratha Empire. Ahilyabai was succeeded by her commander-in-chief and nephew, Tukoji Rao Holkar, who soon abdicated the throne in favour of his son Kashi Rao Holkar in 1797.
           <h3>Children</h3>
            She gave birth to a son Male Rao and daughter Muktabai in 1745 and 1748, respectively. Male Rao became mentally ill in later life and died in 1767 due to his disease. Ahilya Bai married her daughter to Yashwant Rao, a brave but poor man, after he had succeeded in defeating dacoits.</td>

          <td>Rajaram Bhosle I  24 February 1670 - 3 March 1700) was the third Chhatrapati of Maratha Empire, who ruled from 1689 to his death in 1700. He was the second son of the Shivaji, the founder of the empire and younger half-brother of Sambhaji, who he succeeded. His eleven-year reign was marked with a constant struggle against the Mughals. He was succeeded by his infant son Shivaji II under the regentship of his widow Tarabai.
              <h3>Early life and family</h3>
              Rajaram was born in a family of Bhonsle clan, to Shivaji and his younger wife, Soyarabai on 24 February 1670. He was thirteen years younger than his brother, Sambhaji. Given the ambitious nature of Soyarabai, Rajaram was installed on the Maratha throne upon the death of his father in 1680. However, the Maratha generals wanted Sambhaji as the king and thus, he claimed the throne. Upon Sambhaji's death, Rajaram was crowned as Chhatrapati of the Maratha state.

              Rajaram married three times. His first marriage was at the age of ten to Jankibai, the five-year-old daughter of Shivaji's army chief, Prataprao Gujar.His other wives were Tarabai, the daughter of Hambirrao Mohite, the army chief who succeeded Prataprao, and Rajasbai from the influential Ghatge family of Kagal. Rajaram had three sons,
              
              Raja Karna(died in 1700) with mistress Sagunabai 
              Shivaji II with Tarabai,
              Sambhaji II with Rajasbai.
            <h3>Death</h3>Rajaram died of lung disease in 1700 because of excessive use of bidi at Sinhagad near Pune in Maharashtra leaving behind widows and infants.
            Janakibai, one of his widows, committed suicide upon Rajaram's death. Another of Rajaram's widows, Tarabai proclaimed her young son, Shivaji II as the Chhatrapati and ruled as his regent. 
            However, the release of Shahu, by the successors of Aurangzeb led to an internecine conflict between Tarabai and Shahu with the latter becoming the winner and occupant of the throne. 
            Tarabai established a separate seat at Kolhapur and installed her son as the rival Chhatrapati. She was shortly deposed by Rajasbai, the other surviving widow of Rajaram. Rajasbai installed the other son of Rajaram called Sambhaji II on the Kolhapur throne. 
            The Kolhapur line has continued to this day through natural succession and adoptions per Hindu custom.</td>

          <td><h3>Family history</h3>
            Netaji Palkar was born in a small village, called Chouk in Khalapur, Maharashtra, India in a Marathi Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu family.
             Netaji's father was a major Jagirdar in Western Maharashtra under the Adil Shah.
            <h3>Military career</h3>Palkar was made Sarnaubat in the year 1657 after the death of Mankoji Dahatonde.
             During the period of the rise of Shivaji from 1645 to 1665, Netaji was given charge of many expeditions which he successfully completed. His greatest success was the campaign against the Adilshah of Bijapur Sultanate that followed the killing of Afzal Khan.
              His standing among the local population was such that he was known as Prati Shivaji (image of Chhatrapati Shivaji).[3] He disturbed lot of area of Mughals till year 1665. As he did not inform about the actions of Jai Singh and Dilerkhan, Shivaji was upset at him. After the 1665 Treaty of Purandar between Jai Singh and Shivaji,
               Shivaji was forced to give up 23 forts to the Mughals and also fight against the Adilshah of Bijapur. During this period, Netaji Palkar defected to the Bijapur forces. It was the strategy of Shivaji so as to reduce his own military power as Aurangzeb 
               wanted Shivaji to fight for him. Thus Shivaji strategised to defect Netaji Palkar to Adilshah of Bijapur. 
               Therefore as expected by Shivaji, Mughals were unable to conquer Adilshah.

            After Shivaji's meeting with Aurangzeb at Agra, Netaji Palkar joined the service of Jai Singh. When Shivaji escaped from Agra, Mirza Raja fell out of favor of Aurangzeb
          <h3>Capture by the Mughals, conversion to Islam and re-conversion to Hinduism</h3>
          After Shivaji's escape from Agra, Aurangzeb, as a revenge, ordered Jai Singh to arrest Netaji Palkar. He was kept under arrest at Dharur fort for a few days. Also it is said that at the same fort, Jijabai, Shivaji's mother, sent some money to Jai Singh,
           when demanded by Shivaji to distribute sweets in Agra. Netaji Palkar was then converted to Islam. His wives were thereafter brought to Delhi and also converted in order for Netaji to remarry them in the Islamic way. Taking up the name of Muhammad Kuli Khan, Netaji Palkar was appointed as garrison commander of the Kandahar fort in Afghanistan. 
           He tried to escape but was traced and trapped at Lahore. Thereafter, on the battlefields of Kandahar and Kabul, he fought for the Mughals against rebel Pashtuns. 
          Thus he gained the good faith of Aurangzeb and was sent to the Deccan along with Commander Diler Khan to conquer Shivaji's territory.</td>

          <td><h3>Early life</h3>
            Santaji belonged to the historical Ghorpade family which is a branch of the Bhosale clan. 
            Ghorpades were originally called Bhosales. His year of birth is not known, however, it is estimated to be circa 1660. 
            He was the eldest
             of three sons of[citation needed] of Mhaloji Ghorpade, who was the Senapati (General) of Sambhaji. He had two younger brothers named Bahirji and Maloji. His father was step brother of Baji Ghorpade, who was killed by Shivaji, as some sources say Baji contrived along with Afzal Khan in imprisoning and humiliating Shahji Raje Bhosale (Shivaji's father) in Adilshah court. Santaji rose through the ranks under the guidance of Hambirrao Mohite. 
             Santaji and his younger brother Bahirji accompanied Shivaji in his campaign of Jalna in 1679. Shivaji had punished a young Santaji asking him not to show his face for three months when he ignored the retreat warning at Jalna, thus causing delay of Maratha forces. Santaji later on became an important Sardar during Sambhaji's reign. Sambhaji
              had sent him and senior Sardar Keso Trimal Pingle with an army of 17,000 to bring food supplies from the Gingee region in 1686. Santaji was with his father in 
             1689 when Sambhaji was being captured, while Mhaloji refused to leave Sambhaji being his Senapati and died protecting his king in Sangameshwar. 
             Santaji was asked to leave ahead as Sambhaji Maharaj planned to distract invading Mogul forces and escape.[citation needed]. After his untimely and unceremonious death, his sons
             and brothers remained loyal to Rajaram and Tarabai[citation needed], further helping the Maratha cause of Swaraj.
            <h3>Death</h3>An imperial order from emperor Aurangzeb to pursue Santaji was given to Hamiddudin Khan Bahadur. Khan fought with him and recovered some of the elephants of Qasim Khan, which Santaji had looted earlier. Then Khan was ordered to return to the court, leaving some of his officers to accompany Bidar Bakht, who had been ordered to chase Santaji. Several fights occurred, but Santaji escaped every time.

            On the way to Jinji, Santaji had a fight with Dhanaji Jadhav, who was conveying Rajaram to Jinji, on account of an old quarrel. Santaji triumphed, and captured Amrit Rao, brother-in-law of Nagoji, had him trampled down by an elephant. Santaji also captured Rajaram, but Dhanaji escaped. The next day Santaji tied his hands and apologised Rajaram for his rudeness. 
            Then he conducted Rajaram to Jinji. Zulfiqar Khan Bahadur was ordered to besiege the fort. The fort was captured but Santaji escaped with Rajaram and went towards Satara to fight with Dhanaji, who was there. In this battle, Dhanaji triumphed. Santaji fled from the field with only a few men to the zammdari of Nagoji, with whom he sought refuge. Nagoji gave him shelter in his house, but his wife, whose brother had been killed by Santaji,
             urged her husband and another brother not to let Santaji go away alive. Nagoji dismissed, but his wife's brother went in pursuit, seeking for an opportunity to kill Santaji. By this time, Aurangzeb issued an imperial order to Ghaziuddin khan Feroz Jung to pursue Santaji. 
            The troops of Bidar Bhakt and Hamiddudin Khan were placed under his command.</td>

            <p>Firangoji Narsala was a Maratha warrior and military leader in the army of Shivaji, in 17th century India. He is famous for his defence of Sangram Durg, a fort, against a Mughal army led by Shaista Khan in 1660 .
            </p>
Firangoji was a 'Killedar' (fortress commander) of this fort in Chakan (Pune). When Shaista Khan invaded Pune with a lakh of soldiers, he selected Sangram Durga as the first target. He attacked the fort with 20,000 soldiers on 23 June 1660.

Firangoji Narasala was prepared for this attack, however, even though he had only 320 soldiers. Just before this attack Shivaji had asked his commander to leave the fort. However, Firangoji decided not to abandon the fort and instead started a fierce guerrilla war against the Mughals and defended the fort in this way for 56 days. War ended on 14 August 1660.

The Mughals tried another way of taking the fort. They dug a tunnel up to the fort; which was a challenge because of the water around it. They filled this tunnel with explosives and blew up the wall of the fort. This was a major setback for Firangoji and his soldiers; 75 soldiers died in this attack. The Mughal army rushed into the fort; fierce fighting ensued and many Maratha soldiers were killed.

Shaista Khan was astonished by Firangoji's bravery, and offered him Mughal Sardari. But Firangoji refused to accept it; instead Shaista Khan gave him and his soldiers safe passage. Firangoji came to meet Shivaji and apologised for surrendering the fort. But Shivaji was very happy with him as he had defended a small fort for almost 2 months. He said "if it took 60 days for Shaista Khan to take a small fort, imagine how many days will be required to capture an entire swarajya (kingdom). Shaista Khan will be here for few days, he is not going to take Sangram Durg with him. Whatever you have done is praiseworthy". Shivaji rewarded Firangoji and made him Killedar of the Bhupalgad (Bhupal fort)
